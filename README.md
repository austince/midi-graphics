# Midi Graphics
For CS 537 at Stevens Institute of Technology.

Using a 2D pipeline to create something more.

## Building
This is a **maven** project, built in the IntelliJ style.


## Keyboard Support
The examples will run without a midi keyboard
though they are much less fun that way.  

The only currently supported keyboard is the _Akai MPK Mini_.  
 
## Kotlin
I used Kotlin for the Driver of the examples, but the main pieces are all Java.
