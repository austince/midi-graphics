# Midi Graphics
For CS 537 at Stevens Institute of Technology.

Using a 2D pipeline to create something more.

## Building + Running
This is a **maven** project, but some helpful commands are written in the `Makefile`.

- `make` : default build
- `make clean` : clean up
- `make run` : runs the application with default settings

After `make`:  
- `java -jar target/midterm-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar [ARGUMENTS]`

## Application arguments
- run with the `-u` for USAGE
 
## Application commands
- Q : quit
- If using the keyboard: 

## Examples
Press '1' for the Square Example  
Press '2' for the Rectangle Example  

## Keyboard Support
The examples will run without a midi keyboard
though they are much less fun that way.  

The only currently supported keyboard is the _Akai MPK Mini_.  
 
## Kotlin
I used Kotlin for the Driver of the examples, but the main pieces are all Java.
